Hello!
Welcome to hexarchive, I'm Hex!

This is the ultimate archive I used to store my notes and study material.
Through the long way exploring the "right method to learn", I've tried multiple ways to experiment which approach worked best for me...
And here, you'll see all the outcomes!
As an international student from China, there includes a lot of annotations in Chinese, so if you know mandarin as well, they'll be helpful!
Enjoy these notes, and I really hope they could help you.

Any questions? Please email hex@berkeley.edu.
